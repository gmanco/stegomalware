# Stegomalware Sanitization through Deep Learning

This is the accompanying code for the paper 

[Sanitization of Images Containing Stegomalware via Machine Learning Approaches](http://dummylink.com), by Marco Zuppelli, Giuseppe Manco, Luca Caviglione, Massimo Guarascio.

The notebook is essentially self-explanatory. You need Pytorch >= 1.5 to run it. 

- If you have multiple GPU's, you just need to list them in the second cell of the notebook. 
- There are some example images that allow to run the code as it is. However, if you would like to train it on your own images, you need to adhere to the following conventions: 
  - in each (train/test/val) folder there are two subfolders: clean and malware. You need to put the compromised images into the "malware" folder and make sure that the original images are in "clean". 
  - There are some naming conventions for the original and compromised image. E.g., if `image1.png` is a clean image, the compromised version has to have the same name but with a prefix (typically, the ID of the compromission). In this case, `s1_image1.png` is the same image compromised with script `s1`. *Make sure that the prefix ends with the underscore*.
